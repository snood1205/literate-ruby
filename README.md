Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/LiterateRuby.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/LiterateRuby)

## Name
The name is inspired by Literate Haskell.

## Usage

A file like this

```
This is some commentary on ruby code,
and here is some more commentary.

> puts 'this is executable ruby code'
> # of course, you can include comments
> # in here, but why would you?
> class A
>  def you_can_define
>    @classes_and_such = 'in here'
>  end
>  # if you want to 
> end 
```

This is called bird style. There are specs on it
[here](https://wiki.haskell.org/Literate_programming#Bird_Style).

## Future
In the future LaTeX might be used in here as well.
